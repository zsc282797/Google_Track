a) What did I work on last time?
	- Researched how to implement the get command / how to make a connection with a URL.
	- Implemented get with a try catch block for common errors.
b) What do I plan to work on this time?
	-start working on grep
	- think about the overall design, how we are going to direct content into outfiles.

c) Am I currently blocked on anything?
	- Not sure how I should write JUnit or test in general for get.
